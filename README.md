Newtonsoft.Json MonoTouch & MonoDroid Port
==========================================

This is a fork of James NK's famous Newtonsoft.Json library that works with MonoTouch and Mono for Android (MonoDroid).  The goal is to keep it as up to date as possible with the upstream master, and compatible with Xamarin products.

Big thanks goes out to James for making such an awesome library, and Xamarin for taking the obj-c and java pain out of developing for iOS and Android.
